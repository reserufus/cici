Day 24:
Today is Christmas Eve. Today, I will drive to my grandparents. In Germany we always celebrate christmas and spend a lot of time with our relatives. 
Today is always a very busy day for me. But I hope that I can still make a little bit of time to call you. You might be not celebrating christmas but studying for your exams today.
